My name is Daniel Cuadra. I am a US Army Intelligence Corps veteran. I worked in the intelligence community for 8 years under various commands and roles.
                After I completed my service contract with the army, I went back to school. First, I went to community college, then to San Francisco State University.
                I majored in International Relations (diplomacy studies) with an emphasis in economy. After I completed my bachelors degree, I began working at a startup
                company called Vagaro. I started working as technical support, as I had a technical background before my military service. I had studied C++ and worked
                toward a CCNA. After working at Vagaro for 5 years, I was assigned numerous roles, to include: Technical Support Management, Product Management, Merchant
                Services, Sales, and worked on an AI bot. After completing the AI bot project, I rediscovered my passion for coding.
